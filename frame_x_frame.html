		<p class="col-md-12 text-left">Frame x frame began as a project for Intro to User Experience Design at SVA taught by Professor Lauren Connoly in Summer 2018. Initially starting from a prompt to solve a daily issue, of which I chose online shopping, frame x frame  evolved into a personal project that explored graphic fashion design and brand photography alongside its user experience core. </p> 
		
		<p class="col-md-12 text-left"> Being an individual project, I carried out user research as well as design of the mobile shopping app, clothing, and necessary photography.</p>

		<p class="text-center">The brand focuses on graphic, basics for casual wear, offering unisex clothing oriented towards the streetwear culture.

			<p>Having determined the target demographic and issues to be tackled, I began with creating the brand identity that would act as the context of the project; building the brand included designing sample products, model photography,  and logo design.</p>
			<img src="images/fxf/design.png">
			<p>The sample clothing design focuses on simple figure-ground relationships. Icons are appropriated and developed from daily mundane sources like garment tags.</p>

The product photography focuses on building the brand image of urban tranquility - frames of serenity living moment to moment within the bustling Manhattan cityscape.</p>

			<p>The main result of testing concluded tabs to be unnecessary - users didn't use the my store and profile tabs very often. Moving the tabs to a hamburger menu helped to declutter the screen to focus on browsing.</p>
			<br>

			<img style="width:400px; width:auto;" src="images/fxf/iteration2.png">
			<p>The original 'My Store" tab has been nested into 'My Favorites.' It wasn't immediately clear how digitally "shopping in a store" worked, so it transitioned into a way to locate saved items in store. The 'find in store' feature is also available for shopping cart items.</p>

			<p>A feature prioritized was the interaction that would provide recommendations  for fit based on input user data and brands the user was familiar with. Brands often include sizing measurements with their product, but these are often difficult to intuitively understand; here, comparisons with familiar brands are offered as a point of reference.</p>

	<!-- NEXT STEPS -->
		<br>
		<br>
		<div class="subtitle">NEXT STEPS</div>
		<p>Much of frame x frame was a study of existing interactions that took place in traditional online shopping experiences. Moving forward, I'd like to explore how the application relates to the brick and mortar experience as well. </p>
		
		<p>The 'locate item in store' feature is a step in the direction but there is opportunity to test ideas like "sending" a shopping cart in store and having selected clothes collected and ready for you to try when you arrive.</p>
		
		<p>Also, perhaps related to my architectural background, I'd like to envision and design the brick and mortar store itself. I'm interested in how the traditional clothing brick and mortar typology reacts to the integration of these digital features.</p>
