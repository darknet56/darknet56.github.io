		<p class="col-md-12 text-left">Creative Guild is a recruiting service offered by Creative Mornings that we investigated during Research Methods in Interaction Design at SVA taught by Professor Jodi Leo in Summer 2018. I worked with Alex Stempel and Alexandra Weiner as "Team Impossible Burger."</p> 
		
		<p class="col-md-12 text-left">My role in the team was to create the new user-flow of our micro-site proposal. Alex produced mockups and led the interview with a recruiter, and Alexandra led the synthesis of research findings to outline design goals.</p>

		<p class="text-center">Creative Mornings is trying to achieve financial independence without sponsorships; a large part of their goals for Creative Guild involves attracting talent acquisition managers from large companies (defined as 30+ employees) to use their platform. According to the founder Tina, only 1.7% of users that started actually completed the onboarding process. We walked Erik, a Talent Manager at Asana, through the process again to see where pain points and dissatisfaction arose.</p>

			<p>A basic user flow can be represented by the arrival at the Creative Mornings site, our proposed intervention of the Creative Guild microsite, and if the user decides to proceed with the service: the onboarding flow</p>
			<br>

			<p>The microsite is divided into three main effective stages a recruiter might experience as they further investigate Creative Guild. </p>

			<p>The existing creative guild page caters to all user types, through 5 tabs: companies, individuals, jobs, pricing, about. The page presents a lot of information but doesn't quickly provide answers recruiters are looking for.</p>

		<!-- CONCLUSION -->
		<div class="subtitle">CONCLUSION</div>
		<p>We presented our findings to Christina and Kyle, two designers from Creative Guild. They were particularly interested in the "orientation" phase that could help direct different types of users to relevant content.</p>
		<p>While our research covered pain points that prevented users from even reaching the onboarding process, a more comprehensive revision of the onboarding process to clearly address both creative individuals and recruiters would be a clear next step in ensuring users follow through with their interest in Creative Guild. </p>
