		<p class="col-md-12 text-left">Feeling Forward is a project done for Design Innovation 181: Reimagining Mobility at UC Berkeley lead by Professor Purin Phanichphant in Spring 2019. I worked with Lily Lin and Jing Wu. Our project investigates how those afflicted with "invisible disabilities" may face mobility issues on campus.</p> 
		
		<p class="col-md-12 text-left">The roles were evenly split as far as carrying out interviews and research, ideating, and user testing. Lily built the physical prototypes. </p>

		<p>2 x 2: Frequency v. Intensity of Disruption to Daily Life</p>
		<div class="text-center"><img src="images/ff/2x2.png"></div>
		<br>

		<p class="text-center"> We began with a 2x2 analysis to visualize the range of invisible disabilities we were working with and select a set of disabilities to further investigate. This led us to interview two participants that suffered from anxiety disorder and chronic migraines respectively as well as an optometrist that could give us expert view on low vision cases. </p>

				<p class="heavy">chronic migraines</p>
				<p>Migraines can cause extreme sensitivity to light and noises, requiring use of vision limiting measures</p>
				<p>She avoids situations with unpredictable lighting or noises as well as using sensory deprivation tools to avoid incidents</p>

				<p>The unpredictable nature of commute and anxiety from self consciousness often results in enough emotional toll that he chooses not to leave the apartment at all.</p>

				<p>Low-vision patients often prefer driving and parking due to  avoid the stress of the unknown.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<br>
		<br>

		<p class="text-center">Having heard the stories that resulted from some of the invisible disabilities we wanted to work with, we created  a journey map of a theoretical low-vision patient making their way to the UC Berkeley Optometry to help us empathize with a disabled user and identify concerns and opportunities. </p>

			<p>We found that those afflicted with invisible disabilities face skepticism and a unique set of challenges due to the inconsistency of their disabilities - they are generally able to operate normally but face disruptive bouts. </p>

				<p>Our might we statments, representative of our insights, guideed our brainstorming categories. We used a series of short 5-minute session to build out our ideas. We then voted on a couple ideas to move forward with, creating one-page concept expansions.</p>
				<br>

				<br>
				<p>The 'Feeling Forward' concept we moved forward with addressed the concern for using non-visual feedback to guide users, and, being a personal device, avoids uncomfortable interactions in asking for assistance. </p>

		<div class="text-center prototype two-line">
			<img style="margin-bottom: 10px;" src="images/ff/prototype1.png">
			<p>Our first prototype envisioned a soft object that utilized haptic feedback and was linked to a smartphone for inputting navigation destination.</p>

		<div class="two-line text-center">
			<img style="margin-bottom: 10px;" src="images/ff/prototype2.png">
			<p>The second prototype is more experiential, maintaining the soft exterior based on feedback from the first prototype but sheds the mobile app requirement, using voice recognition instead. The prototype gives auditory directions and vibrates to provide haptic feedback to notify the user that they were veering off course or approaching obstacles.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img style="margin-bottom: 10px;" src="images/ff/test_interaction.svg">
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>We used a sample script and acted as the feeling forward device in voicing instructions and activating the cat toy inside to create vibrations. Whenever the user veered off course, we activated the device. The device vibrates until the user rotated around back to facing the right direction.</p></div>
